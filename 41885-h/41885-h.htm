<p>&#8268; THE TEMPLE OF KWAN-YIN, GODDESS OF MERCY. <span class="red">A wide altar occupies
the whole of the back of the stage; a long fringe of strips of yellow
brocade hangs from the ceiling to within 3 feet of the floor at either
end of the altar. In the centre of the altar the seated figure of the
goddess is vaguely visible in the dimness; only the face is definitely
seen&mdash;a golden face; the expression is passionless and aloof. A long
table about 12 inches lower than the altar stands in front of it, right
across the stage. On the table, before the feet of Kwan-yin, is her
carved tablet with her name in golden characters on a red lacquer
ground. In front of the tablet is a large brass bowl full of joss-sticks
the smoke of which wavers in the air &amp; occasionally obscures the face of
Kwan-yin. There are several plates of waxen looking fruit &amp; cakes on the
table &amp; two horn lanterns&mdash;these are the only light in the scene. On
either side of Kwan-yin, between the table and the altar, there is a
pillar with a gilded wooden dragon twisted round it, head downward. To
the left, forward, is a large barrel-shaped drum slung on a carved
blackwood stand.</span></p>

<p class="red">Four priests &amp; two acolytes are seen like shadows before this palely lit
background. One acolyte to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> right of the table beats a little hoarse
bell. This he does during the course of the whole scene, in the
following rhythm:&mdash;7-8-20-7-8-20. He should reach the 105th beat at the
end of the second hymn to Kwan-yin. The other acolyte stands by the drum
and beats it softly at irregular intervals as indicated. The acolytes
are little boys in long blue coats. The four priests stand at the table
with their faces toward Kwan-yin; their robes are pale dull pink silk
with a length of deeper apricot pink draped about the shoulders.</p>

<p class="p2 red">The priests kneel and kow-tow to Kwan-yin.</p>

<p class="red">The acolytes sing:</p>

</div></div>

<p class="red">First priest&mdash;tenor&mdash;chants:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Is she then a warrior against sin?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On what field does she plant her banner?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bears she a sword?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">First and second priests&mdash;tenor and bass&mdash;chant:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The world is very full of battle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The speared and plumed forests in their ranks besiege the mountains;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The flooded fields like scimitars lie between the breasts of the mountains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mists ride on bugling winds down the mountains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall not Kwan-yin bear a sword?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">Third priest&mdash;tenor&mdash;chants:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin is no warrior.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin bears no sword.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even against sin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin has no battle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is her banner&mdash;a new day, a forgetting hour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hands are empty of weapons and outstretched to the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her feet are set on lotus flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lotus flowers are set on a pale lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lake is filled with the tears of the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin is still, she is very still, she listens always,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin lives remembering tears.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">At this point the smoke of the joss-sticks veils the face of Kwan-yin. A
woman's voice sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wherefore remember tears?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall tears be dried by remembrance?<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<p class="red">This voice is apparently not heard by the priests and acolytes.</p>

<p class="red">First and third priests chant:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, Kwan-yin, mother of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remember<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those in pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those who are held fast in pain of their own or another's seeking.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those for whom the world is too difficult<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And too beautiful to bear,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">All:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin, remember, remember.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">First and third priests:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Those who are blind, who shall never read the writing upon the fierce rivers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shall never see the slow flowing of the stars from mountain to mountain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those who are deaf, whom music and the fellowship of words have forsaken<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">All:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin, remember, remember.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<p class="red">First and third priests:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Those whose love is buried and broken;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All those under the sun who lack the thing that they love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And under the moon cry out because of their lack,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">All:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin, remember.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">First priest:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh thou taker away of pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou taker away of tears....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">The smoke quivers across Kwan-yin's face again, and the same woman's
voice sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wherefore remember the desolate?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is there a road of escape out of the unending wilderness?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can Kwan-yin find a way where there is no way?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">Still the voice is unheard by the worshippers. First priest sings, and
while he sings the acolyte beats the drum softly at quick irregular
intervals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin shall come, shall come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely she shall come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring content and a new diamond day to the desolate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring the touch of hands &amp; the song of birds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To those who walk terribly alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To part the russet earth and the fingers of the leaves in the spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they may give up their treasure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To those who faint for lack of such treasure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To listen to the long complaining of the old and the unwanted.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring lover to lover across the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrusting the stars aside and cleaving the seas and the mountains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hold up the high paths beneath the feet of travellers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep the persuading roar of waters from the ears of the broken-hearted.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring a smile to the narrow lips of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make beautiful the eyes of death.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">A woman's voice again sings, unheeded, from behind the veil of smoke.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wherefore plead with death?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shall soften the terrible heart of death?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">All, in urgent but slow unison:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kwan-yin.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">The golden face of Kwan-yin above the altar changes suddenly and
terribly, and becomes like a masque of fear. The lanterns flare
spasmodically. The voice can now be identified as Kwan-yin's, but still
the priests stand unhearing with their heads bowed, and still the
passionless bell rings.</p>

<p class="red">Kwan-yin, in a screaming voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, be still, be still....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am Kwan-yin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am Mercy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mercy is defeated.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mercy who battled not, is defeated.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She is a captive bound to the chariot of pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrow has set his foot upon her neck.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sin has mocked her.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn away thine eyes from Mercy,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
<span class="i0">From poor Mercy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woo her no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cry upon her no more.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">There is an abrupt moment of silence as the light becomes dim again &amp;
Kwan-yin's face is frozen still. Then the first priest sings.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What then are Mercy's gifts? The rose-red slopes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hills ... the secret twisted hands of trees?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall not the moon &amp; the stars redeem lost hopes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What fairer gifts shall Mercy bring than these?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For, in the end, when our beseeching clamor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dies with our bells; when fear devours our words;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, she shall come &amp; hold the night with glamor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, she shall come &amp; sow the dawn with birds.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah thou irrelevant saviour, ah thou bringer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of treasure from the empty sky, ah thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who answerest death with song, shall such a singer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be silent now? Shall thou be silent now?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="red">The 105th beat of the bell is now reached and there is a pause in the
ringing.</p>

<p class="red">All:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">KWAN-YIN.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p class="red">The bell is rung slowly three times. Then there is absolute silence.
There is now a tenseness in the attitudes of all the worshippers, they
lean forward and look with suspense into Kwan-yin's quite impassive
golden face.</p>

<p class="red">The lights go out suddenly.</p>
